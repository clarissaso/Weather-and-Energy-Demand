# **Dataset**

The folder is structured as follows:
/course/data/a2/weather/weather_data.csv
/course/data/a2/weather/description.txt
/course/data/a2/weather/price_demand_data.csv
        
The weather dataset includes the weather of four cities, including Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, measured from February 2021 until March 2022. The energy demand data is collected from February 18th 2021, until March 18th 2022. The weather data of the cities is sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology website, which measures the minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), rainfall (mm), evaporation (mm), sunshine (hours), the direction of a maximum wind gust, speed of maximum wind gust (km/h), time of maximum wind gust, 9 am temperature (°C), 9 am relative humidity (%), 9 am cloud amount (oktas), 9 am wind direction, 9 am wind speed (km/h), 9 am MSL pressure (hPa), 3 pm temperature (°C), 3 pm relative humidity (%), 3 pm cloud amount (oktas), 3 pm wind direction, 3 pm wind speed (km/h) and 3 pm MSL pressure (hPa). Furthermore, the energy demand data was sourced from Victoria and New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia with four key variables, region, settlement data, total demand and price surge.

# **Weather and Energy Demand**
Using this dataset, research questions such as ‘How does temperature affect price surge and the demand for energy across different cities in Australia?’ could be answered. This question could interest energy retailers in Australia as it provides beneficial information. For example, higher temperatures may raise or lower energy demand. Fewer energy resources will be needed for heating purposes, mainly in the winter season; more energy (particularly electricity) will be required to run air conditioners and other cooling devices in the summer.
